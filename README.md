## VoidBlade

The project is currently at the beginning of its development.

One of my personal goals in programming is to create my own first person shooter game from 90s similar to DOOM. Without any shortcuts and just using [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) with pure C.

As a first step I implemented ray casting. Results are below:

![raycast result 2](./screen/raycast_2.png)

### Build & Run

```bash
$ make
```

Binary is in the root directory:

```bash
$ ./voidblade
```
